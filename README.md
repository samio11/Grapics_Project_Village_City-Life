# 🌆 Village & City View — Computer Graphics Project

This is a Computer Graphics project built using C++ and OpenGL/GLUT. It presents two distinct views: a dynamic **village** and a **city**, complete with moving cars, trucks, boats, windmills, and more. This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in 2D graphics, animation, and scene switching.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌄 Village View:
  - Sunrise scene
  - Moving truck, car, and boat
  - Spinning windmill
  - Trees, houses, and river
  - Animated clouds and sun

- 🌃 City View:
  - Night sky with moon
  - Streetlights with dynamic lighting
  - Multiple buildings and moving cars
  - Trees and footpaths

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- Graphics: OpenGL, GLUT

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as part of my **Computer Graphics** course to understand how 2D graphical scenes are constructed, animated, and rendered using OpenGL.
